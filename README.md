# Spring-Joke-App

This is a simple SpringFramework web app that displays a Chuck Norris joke as derived from 

a Maven dependency JAR. Which is injected into the SpringFramework via constructor for the JokeServiceImpl

class. The JokeController maps the request and returns a random joke, then renders this joke on the view.
